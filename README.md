- 👋 Hi, I’m @lealhuber
- 👀 I’m interested in evolutionary genetics, how organisms adapt to their environment, and what the genetic constraints of this adaptation are.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about ostriches and how they are adapted to the highly fluctuating climate they thrive in. But mostly I am still figuring out research, genomics, how to organise, write scrips... and how to use git and github 😅.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the interaction of endotherms (especially birds) with their gut microbiota and how that influences thermoregulation.
- 📫 How to reach me: leahuber\[at\]bio.au.dk

- ⚡ Fun fact: My dream is to explore Iceland on horseback 🇮🇸 🌋 🏇
